# meditation
Meditation being my first web application to add to my project list, was created using native JavaScript and HTML with a little bit of CSS. The absence of a css framework like Bootstrap and my novice expertise in CSS has given it a rugged look. I have hosted the application in Netlify. You can try the application [here](https://medit8.netlify.com).

Meditation is a single page web application with a home screen that serves as the hub for all controls for the app. There is a prominent play button with three choices of timer and a dynamic count down animation showing the time left. There are three choices of sounds you can choose from with respective video being played in the background. The playback stops once the timer has end. 

#### Coming up 
* Better UI using bootstrap framework providing support for mobile playback

* Much more diverse choices to chose from

#### Language used
